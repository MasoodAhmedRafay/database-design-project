* Database Design Project

** Diagram
Made using erdplus.com standalone, exported to json-ish (through save)
Generated graph in LaTex through tikz
*** Diagram generation
The diag. gen. was a bit over the top perhaps. But it was fun :)
If I can't get it to look pleasant I'll just add the image from erdplus.com later.
**** TODO Make it look decent.
** Report
*** TODO Add your names to the title page.
Run make to regenerate diagram and export to pdf using pdflatex.

** Code
*** TODO Choose language
As we will inevitably write some code at some point; we're supposed to pick a language. The course suggests Java or Python,
out of which I (Samuel) prefer Python. Any objections or other ideas?
